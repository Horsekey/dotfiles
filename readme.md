# Things to add / fixes to make

- setup script doesn't include bash_aliases
- doesn't download fonts
- some tmux thing depends on brew?
- doesn't install lazy nvim which could be fine, but something to improve
- I believe it was difficult to get windows username through wsl, that's why I have it setup as a prompt
- no feedback for the user about what exactly happened / what symlinks are made
	- would be nice to add what aliases are new
- doesn't grab my specific private notes repo
